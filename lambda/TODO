* C
- What do static inline volatile extern in C do?
- Read up on "global" variables and modules
- Flexarray? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sizeof
- License? (github)

* AVR
- What happens if USART data is sent to the AVR too fast (GtkTerm Send Raw File)

* Functionality
- Add rules and alerts according to FIRE RULEZ!
  
* Circuit
- Look at oxygen sensor voltage with voltmeter/oscilloscope - is the voltage
  really so unstable?
- Verify ADC voltages against voltmeter with other uC (ADC_OFFSET_MV)
