* C
- Check other use of const (return value?)
- Flexarray? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sizeof

* AVR
- What happens if USART data is sent to the AVR too fast (GtkTerm Send Raw File)

* Functionality
- Implement i18n
  
* Circuit
- Look at oxygen sensor voltage with voltmeter/oscilloscope - is the voltage
  really so unstable?
- Put button and beeper pins in pins.h (watch out with OCR1A)
- AVcc should be connected to Vcc via an LC network
- ADC 5 and 4 use digital power while ADC 3-0 use analog power!
